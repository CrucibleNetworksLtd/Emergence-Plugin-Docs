# Configuration

The configuration field on the emergence overlay can be overridden with your own details, the easiest way to do this would be to make a copy of the default configuration:

### Default IPFS Gateway

If you had your own IPFS gateway that you would like to use then change this, it is an advanced use case so for most of you there is no need to change it.

### Chain

To change the chain that you are on then you can change this field. As you can see in the screenshot there are 4 provided with Emergence by default.
