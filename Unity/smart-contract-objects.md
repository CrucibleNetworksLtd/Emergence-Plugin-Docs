# Smart Contract Objects

To interact with smart contracts in Emergence you can use 2 scriptable objects to interact with smart contracts:

There are examples in: `Assets/Emergence/Samples/EmergenceDemo/Resources`

The objects are self explanatory if you are familiar with the following terms:

**Smart Contracts:**

Smart contracts are self-executing contracts on blockchain networks that automate the execution of agreements, eliminating intermediaries and providing a secure, decentralized way of conducting transactions.

**ABI (Application Binary Interface):**

The ABI is a JSON representation of a smart contract's functions and events, enabling applications to encode and decode data when interacting with the smart contract on the blockchain.

**Chains:**

Chains refer to the various blockchain networks, such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon, which host decentralized applications and smart contracts, each offering different levels of scalability, security, and decentralization.
