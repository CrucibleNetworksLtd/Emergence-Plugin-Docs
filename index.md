# What Is Emergence SDK?

Emergence is a Web3 plugin for Unreal Engine and Unity. Emergence empowers game developers with wallet authentication, reading from and writing to smart contracts, making using of VRM avatars and other models from blockchains and NFT inventory services. Our tooling allows players to then easily sign-in using their crypto wallets and make use of their blockchain assets in games.

Emergence is designed to be the easy on-ramp for the Open Metaverse, made available in games, virtual worlds, virtual reality and more via integration of the Emergence SDK.

We have both a [Unreal](/game-engines/unreal) and [Unity](Unity) plugin.
